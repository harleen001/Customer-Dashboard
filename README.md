Customer Payment Dashboard
A high-performance, pixel-perfect React dashboard built as part of a Frontend Developer Technical Assessment. This application manages customer payment data with full CRUD capabilities, persistent mock storage, and a refined UI.

🚀 Tech Stack
Framework: React 18 (Vite)

Language: TypeScript

State Management (UI): Zustand (Selection logic, Modal states)

State Management (Server): TanStack Query v5 (Data fetching, caching, and mutations)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + ShadCn UI

Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod (Validation)

Icons: Lucide React

Architectural Choices
1. State Separation
I implemented a dual-state architecture to ensure high performance and maintainability:

TanStack Query: Handles all "Server-side" logic. It manages the lifecycle of customer data, including loading states, caching, and automatic re-fetching after mutations (Add/Update/Delete).

Zustand: Manages "Client-side" UI state. Specifically, it tracks row selections and search queries, allowing for a decoupled and lightweight way to communicate between the Header, Table, and Modal components.

2. Mock API & Persistence
To simulate a real-world environment, I created an asynchronous API wrapper in src/lib/api.ts.

Uses localStorage to persist data across page refreshes.

Implements artificial delays to demonstrate TanStack Query's loading/skeleton states.

Maps raw data to the required TypeScript Customer interface.

3. Pixel-Perfect UI
Custom Design System: Extended tailwind.config.ts with custom HSL variables to match Figma's specific status colors (Open/Paid/Due/Inactive).

ShadCn Customization: Modified the standard ShadCn Checkbox and Table components to achieve the specific square-edge design and blue brand indicators requested.

📦 Installation & Setup

Features implemented
✅ Dynamic Table: Responsive layout with conditional status badges.
✅ Smart Selection: Contextual buttons that swap between "Add Customer" and "Update Customer" based on row selection.
✅ Bulk Actions: Ability to select multiple rows and perform bulk deletions.
✅ Form Validation: Robust validation using Zod to prevent incorrect data entry.
✅ Search & Filtering: Real-time client-side filtering via the search bar.
✅ Loading States: Integrated Skeletons for a smooth user experience during data fetching.
